# CSS FLOAT AND CLEAR

The float and clear properties in CSS are used to control the layout and positioning of floated elements within a document
## `float Property`:
The float property is used to specify whether an element should be floated to the left or right side of its containing element. When an element is floated, it is taken out of the normal document flow and positioned to the left or right, allowing other elements to flow around it.

```css
img {
  float: left; /* Float the image to the left */
}
```
Values for the float property:

- **left**: The element floats to the left.
- **right**: The element floats to the right.
- **none**: The default value. The element does not float.
## clear Property:
The clear property is used to control whether an element can be positioned next to floated elements that precede it. It determines on which side of the floated elements the element is not allowed to float.

```css
p {
  clear: both; /* The paragraph does not allow floating elements on either side */
}
```
Values for the clear property:

- **none**: No restriction. The element can be positioned next to floated elements on both sides.
- **left**: The element does not allow floating elements on its left side.
- **right**: The element does not allow floating elements on its right side.
- **both**: The element does not allow floating elements on either side.
